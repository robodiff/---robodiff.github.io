**Sam Kriegman**
is an assistant professor of computer science, chemical and biological engineering, and mechanical engineering at Northwestern University. 
His research seeks general theories of life, in which the details of carbon-based organisms would represent a special case.
An AI2050 Fellow and Cozzarelli Prize recipient, he is the co-creator of the world's first computer-designed organisms (the "xenobots") and the director of the Xenobot Lab.
